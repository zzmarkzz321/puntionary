Change the color, position or any keyframable value!\nLottie also supports native UIViewController Transitions out of the box!\n\nHere is just a small sampling of the power of Lottie\n\n![Example1](_Gifs/Examples1.gif)\n![Example2](_Gifs/Examples2.gif)\n\n<img src=\"_Gifs/Community 2_3.gif\" />\n\n![Example3](_Gifs/Examples3.gif)\n\n![Abcs](_Gifs/Examples4.gif)\n\n## Installing Lottie\n\n### Github Repo\nYou can pull the [Lottie Github Repo](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/) and include the Lottie.xcodeproj to build a dynamic or static library.\n\n### Cocoapods\nGet [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/)\nAdd the pod to your podfile\n```\npod 'lottie-ios'\n```\nrun\n```\npod install\n```\n\nAfter installing the cocoapod into your project import Lottie with\nObjective C\n`#import <Lottie/Lottie.h>` \nSwift\n`import Lottie`\n\n### Carthage\nGet [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)\n\nAdd Lottie to your Cartfile\n```\ngithub \"airbnb/lottie-ios\" \"master\"\n```\nrun\n```\ncarthage update\n```\n\nIn your application targets “General” tab under the “Linked Frameworks and Libraries” section, drag and drop lottie-ios.framework from the Carthage/Build/iOS directory that `carthage update` produced.\n\n## iOS Sample App\n\nClone this repo and try out [the Sample App](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/tree/master/Example)\nThe repo can build a MacOS Example and an iOS Example\n\nThe iOS Example App demos several of the features of Lottie\n\n![Example 1](_Gifs/iosexample1.png)![Example 2](_Gifs/iosexample2.png)\n![Example 3](_Gifs/iosexample3.png)\n\nThe animation Explorer allows you to scrub, play, loop, and resize animations.\nAnimations can be loaded from the app bundle or from [Lottie Files](http://www.lottiefiles.com) using the built in QR Code reader.\n\n## MacOS Sample App\n\nClone this repo and try out [the Sample App](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/tree/master/Example)\nThe repo can build a MacOS Example and an iOS Example\n\n![Lottie Viewer](_Gifs/macexample.png)\n\nThe Lottie Viewer for MacOS allows you to drag and drop JSON files to open, play, scrub and loop animations. This app is backed by the same animation code as the iOS app, so you will get an accurate representation of Mac and iOS animations.\n\n\n## Objective C Examples\n\n\nLottie animations can be loaded from bundled JSON or from a URL\nTo bundle JSON just add it and any images that the animation requires to your target in xcode.\n\n```objective-c\nLOTAnimationView *animation = [LOTAnimationView animationNamed:@\"Lottie\"];\n[self.view addSubview:animation];\n[animation playWithCompletion:^(BOOL animationFinished) {\n// Do Something\n}];\n```\n\nIf you are working with multiple bundles you can use.\n\n```objective-c\nLOTAnimationView *animation = [LOTAnimationView animationNamed:@\"Lottie\" inBundle:[NSBundle YOUR_BUNDLE]];\n[self.view addSubview:animation];\n[animation playWithCompletion:^(BOOL animationFinished) {\n// Do Something\n}];\n```\n\nOr you can load it programmatically from a NSURL\n```objective-c\nLOTAnimationView *animation = [[LOTAnimationView alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:URL]];\n[self.view addSubview:animation];\n```\n\nLottie supports the iOS `UIViewContentModes` aspectFit, aspectFill and scaleFill\n\nYou can also set the animation progress interactively.\n```objective-c\nCGPoint translation = [gesture getTranslationInView:self.view];\nCGFloat progress = translation.y / self.view.bounds.size.height;\nanimationView.animationProgress = progress;\n```\n\nOr you can play just a portion of the animation:\n```objective-c\n[lottieAnimation playFromProgress:0.25 toProgress:0.5 withCompletion:^(BOOL animationFinished) {\n// Do Something\n}];\n```\n## Swift Examples\n\nLottie animations can be loaded from bundled JSON or from a URL\nTo bundle JSON just add it and any images that the animation requires to your target in xcode.\n\n```swift\nlet animationView = LOTAnimationView(name: \"LottieLogo\")\nself.view.addSubview(animationView)\nanimationView.play{ (finished) in\n      // Do Something\n}\n```\n\nIf your animation is in another bundle you can use\n```swift\nlet animationView = LOTAnimationView(name: \"LottieLogo\" bundle:yourBundle)\nself.view.addSubview(animationView)\nanimationView.play()\n```\n\nOr you can load it asynchronously from a URL\n```swift\nlet animationView = LOTAnimationView(contentsOf: WebURL)\nself.view.addSubview(animationView)\nanimationView.play()\n```\n\nYou can also set the animation progress interactively.\n```swift\nlet translation = gesture.getTranslationInView(self.view)\nlet progress = translation.y / self.view.bounds.size.height;\nanimationView.animationProgress = progress\n```\n\nOr you can play just a portion of the animation:\n```swift\nanimationView.play(fromProgress: 0.25, toProgress: 0.5, withCompletion: nil)\n```\n\n## iOS View Controller Transitioning\n\nLottie comes with a `UIViewController` animation-controller for making custom viewController transitions!\n\n![Transition1](_Gifs/transitionMasked.gif)\n![Transition2](_Gifs/transitionPosition.gif)\n\nJust become the delegate for a transition\n\n```objective-c\n- (void)_showTransitionA {\n  ToAnimationViewController *vc = [[ToAnimationViewController alloc] init];\n  vc.transitioningDelegate = self;\n  [self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:NULL];\n}\n```\n\nAnd implement the delegate methods with a `LOTAnimationTransitionController`\n\n```objective-c\n#pragma mark -- View Controller Transitioning\n\n- (id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)animationControllerForPresentedController:(UIViewController *)presented\npresentingController:(UIViewController *)presenting\nsourceController:(UIViewController *)source {\nLOTAnimationTransitionController *animationController = [[LOTAnimationTransitionController alloc] initWithAnimationNamed:@\"vcTransition1\"\nfromLayerNamed:@\"outLayer\"\ntoLayerNamed:@\"inLayer\"\napplyAnimationTransform:NO];\nreturn animationController;\n}\n\n- (id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)animationControllerForDismissedController:(UIViewController *)dismissed {\nLOTAnimationTransitionController *animationController = [[LOTAnimationTransitionController alloc] initWithAnimationNamed:@\"vcTransition2\"\nfromLayerNamed:@\"outLayer\"\ntoLayerNamed:@\"inLayer\"\napplyAnimationTransform:NO];\nreturn animationController;\n}\n\n```\n\nBy setting `applyAnimationTransform` to YES you can make the Lottie animation move the from and to view controllers. They will be positioned at the origin of the layer. When set to NO Lottie just masks the view controller with the specified layer while resepecting z order.\n\n## Debugging\nLottie has a couple of debugging features to know about. \nWhen an animation is loaded unsupported features are logged out in the console with their function names.\n\nIf you checkout LOTHelpers.h you will see two debug flags. `ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING` and `ENABLE_DEBUG_SHAPES`. \n`ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING` increases the verbosity of Lottie Logging. It logs anytime an animation node is set during animation. If your animation if not working, turn this on and play your animation. The console log might give you some clues as to whats going on.\n\n`ENABLE_DEBUG_SHAPES` Draws a colored square for the anchor-point of every layer and shape. This is helpful to see if anything is on screen.\n\n### Keypaths\n\nLOTAnimationView provides `- (void)logHierarchyKeypaths` which will recursively log all settable keypaths for the animation. This is helpful for changing animationations at runtime.\n\n## Changing Animations At Runtime\n\nLottie can do more than just play beautiful animations. Lottie allows you to **change** animations at runtime.\n\n### Say we want to create 4 toggle switches.\n![Toggle](_Gifs/switch_Normal.gif)\nIts easy to create the four switches and play them:\n```swift\nlet animationView = LOTAnimationView(name: \"toggle\");\nself.view.addSubview(animationView)\nanimationView.frame.origin.x = 40\nanimationView.frame.origin.y = 20\nanimationView.autoReverseAnimation = true\nanimationView.loopAnimation = true\nanimationView.play()\n\nlet animationView2 = LOTAnimationView(name: \"toggle\");\nself.view.addSubview(animationView2)\nanimationView2.frame.origin.x = 40\nanimationView2.frame.origin.y = animationView.frame.maxY + 4\nanimationView2.autoReverseAnimation = true\nanimationView2.loopAnimation = true\nanimationView2.play()\n\nlet animationView3 = LOTAnimationView(name: \"toggle\");\nself.view.addSubview(animationView3)\nanimationView3.frame.origin.x = 40\nanimationView3.frame.origin.y = animationView2.frame.maxY + 4\nanimationView3.autoReverseAnimation = true\nanimationView3.loopAnimation = true\nanimationView3.play()\n\nlet animationView4 = LOTAnimationView(name: \"toggle\");\nself.view.addSubview(animationView4)\nanimationView4.frame.origin.x = 40\nanimationView4.frame.origin.y = animationView3.frame.maxY + 4\nanimationView4.autoReverseAnimation = true\nanimationView4.loopAnimation = true\nanimationView4.play()\n\n```\n### Now lets change their colors\n![Recolored Toggle](_Gifs/switch_BgColors.gif)\n```swift\nanimationView2.setValue(UIColor.green, forKeypath: \"BG-On.Group 1.Fill 1.Color\", atFrame: 0)\nanimationView3.setValue(UIColor.red, forKeypath: \"BG-On.Group 1.Fill 1.Color\", atFrame: 0)\nanimationView4.setValue(UIColor.orange, forKeypath: \"BG-On.Group 1.Fill 1.Color\", atFrame: 0)\n```\n\n```objective-c\n[animationView2 setValue:[UIColor greenColor]\n              forKeypath:@\"BG-On.Group 1.Fill 1.Color\"\n                 atFrame:@0];\n```\nThe keyPath is a dot separated path of layer and property names from After Effects.\nLOTAnimationView provides `- (void)logHierarchyKeypaths` which will recursively log all settable keypaths for the animation.\n![Key Path](_Gifs/aftereffectskeypath.png)\n\"BG-On.Group 1.Fill 1.Color\"\n\n### Now lets change a couple of properties\n![Multiple Colors](_Gifs/switch_MultipleBgs.gif)\n```swift\nanimationView2.setValue(UIColor.green, forKeypath: \"BG-On.Group 1.Fill 1.Color\", atFrame: 0)\nanimationView2.setValue(UIColor.red, forKeypath: \"BG-Off.Group 1.Fill 1.Color\", atFrame: 0)\n```\n\nLottie allows you to change **any** property that is animatable in After Effects. If a keyframe does not exist, a linear keyframe is created for you. If a keyframe does exist then just its data is replaced.\n\n\n## Supported After Effects Features\n\n### Keyframe Interpolation\n\n---\n\n* Linear Interpolation\n* Bezier Interpolation\n* Hold Interpolation\n* Rove Across Time\n* Spatial Bezier\n\n### Solids\n\n---\n\n* Transform Anchor Point\n* Transform Position\n* Transform Scale\n* Transform Rotation\n* Transform Opacity\n\n### Masks\n\n---\n\n* Path\n* Opacity\n* Multiple Masks (additive, subtractive and intersection)\n\n### Track Mattes\n\n---\n\n* Alpha Matte\n\n### Parenting\n\n---\n\n* Multiple Parenting\n* Nulls\n\n### Shape Layers\n\n---\n\n* Anchor Point\n* Position\n* Scale\n* Rotation\n* Opacity\n* Path\n* Group Transforms (Anchor point, position, scale etc)\n* Rectangle (All properties)\n* Eclipse (All properties)\n* Multiple paths in one group\n* Even-Odd winding paths\n* Reverse Fill Rule\n\n#### Stroke (shape layer)\n\n---\n\n* Stroke Color\n* Stroke Opacity\n* Stroke Width\n* Line Cap\n* Dashes (Now Animated!)\n\n#### Fill (shape layer)\n\n---\n\n* Fill Color\n* Fill Opacity\n\n#### Trim Paths (shape layer)\n\n---\n\n* Trim Paths Start\n* Trim Paths End\n* Trim Paths Offset\n\n### Repeaters\n\n---\n\n* Supports repeater transforms\n* Offset currently not supported.\n\n### Gradients\n\n---\n\n* Support for Linear Gradients\n* Support for Radial Gradients\n\n### Polystar and Polygon\n\n---\n\n* Supported!

Build animations by hand. Building animations by hand is a huge time commitment for design and engineering across Android and iOS. It's often hard or even impossible to justify spending so much time to get an animation right.\n2. [Facebook Keyframes](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Keyframes). Keyframes is a wonderful new library from Facebook that they built for reactions. However, Keyframes doesn't support some of Lottie's features such as masks, mattes, trim paths, dash patterns, and more.\n2. Gifs. Gifs are more than double the size of a bodymovin JSON and are rendered at a fixed size that can't be scaled up to match large and high density screens.\n3. Png sequences. Png sequences are even worse than gifs in that their file sizes are often 30-50x the size of the bodymovin json and also can't be scaled up.\n\n## Why is it called Lottie?\nLottie is named after a German film director and the foremost pioneer of silhouette animation. Her best known films are The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926) – the oldest surviving feature-length animated film, preceding Walt Disney's feature-length Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) by over ten years\n[The art of Lotte Reineger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvU55CUw5Ck&feature=youtu.be)\n\n## Contributing\nContributors are more than welcome. Just upload a PR with a description of your changes.\n\nIf you would like to add more JSON files feel free to do so!\n\n## Issues or feature requests?\nFile github issues for anything that is unexpectedly broken. If an After Effects file is not working, please attach it to your issue. Debugging without the original file is much more difficult. Lottie is developed and maintained by [Brandon Withrow](mailto:brandon.withrow@airbnb.com). Feel free to reach out via email or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theWithra)\n\n## Roadmap (In no particular order)\n- Add support for interactive animated transitions\n- Animation Breakpoints/Seekpoints\n",
